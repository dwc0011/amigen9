This script unmounts, and optionally wipes, the chroot-dev target-disk

~~~
./Umount.sh --help
Usage: ./Umount.sh [GNU long option] [option] ...
  Options:
        -c  Where chroot-dev is set up (default: "/mnt/ec2-root")
        -C  Device to clean
        -h  Print this message
  GNU long options:
        --chroot            See "-c" short-option
        --clean             See "-C" short-option
        --help              See "-h" short-option
~~~

Each of the functionality flag-options may also be specified by using environment variables:

- `CHROOT`: Stands in for the `-c`/`--chroot` flag-option. Specify only if previously-executed scripts specified a different location for the mounted chroot environment
- `TARGDISK`: Stands in for the `-C`/`--clean` flag-option. Specify only if wishing to wipe the chroot-dev target-disk

Further, additional output/logging can be generated by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to "`true`". Doing so causes information that is normally only directed to syslog to also be printed to `STDOUT`.

## Notes:

<sup>1</sup>If invoking scripts interactively, the `DEBUG` value is automatically set to true.
